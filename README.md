# sndcpy-auto cast shell

This is an forked copy of https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy to include following:

* Casting auto audio cast authorization in mobile with audio mute and shell input using `sndcpy-auto` shell script
* Device Selection if multiple devices are connected taken from https://gist.github.com/dtmilano/4537110

The purpose is to enable [audio forwarding][issue14] while mirroring with
[scrcpy]. However, it can be used independently.
